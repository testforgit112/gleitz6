howdoi - a unix code search tool
========================

Are you a hack programmer? Do you find yourself constantly Googling for how to do basic programing tasks?

Suppose you want to know how to format a date in bash. Why open your browser and read through blogs when you can just...

    $ howdoi format string bash
    > date +"%m-%d-%y"

Usage:

`howdoi query`
