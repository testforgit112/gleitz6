# Howdoi

Are you a hack programmer? Do you find yourself constantly Googling for how to do basic programming tasks?

Suppose you want to know how to format a date in bash. Why open your browser and read through blogs (risking major distraction) when you can simply stay in the code editor and ask [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi#howdoi):



## Getting Started

The howdoi extension enables users to ask howdoi within their own code editor. 

For usage within the code editor:

1. Write down your question in the code editor commented out with a single line comment



2. Highlight the text from the first step




3. Open the command palette using `cmd/ctrl + shift + P`

4. Run howdoi in command palette

5. Choose among three answers from the drop down

6. The answer will be displayed in the code editor along with the question and link.

## Requirements
